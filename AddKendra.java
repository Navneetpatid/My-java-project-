Request for HAP Support on Upcoming Issues
Dear Team,
I hope you are doing well.
I would like to request your HAP support for any upcoming issues. If any issue arises, please make sure to inform me immediately and include me in the discussion.
In case any issue is identified and I am not initially involved, I request that after your review and analysis, you kindly update me with the complete details, including the impact and resolution steps taken.
This will help us ensure proper coordination and smooth issue resolution.
Thank you for your continued support.
Best Regards,
Navneet
